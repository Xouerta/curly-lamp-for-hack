The c sourcefile for the Ultralegends ,that's my first imagine of the game 

I wanna tomake it more playful just like A REAL WORLD.

maybe my dream would realize or not 

but who cares?

the new realese for the ultra legendsv1.2.5!

inspried by genshi impact and hotta ,i decided to add some lucky part in the game 

players can use the core to make wish!

the god(the system ,of course) could possibly give you some kind repeats,or just leave you alone...

have a happy game,and welcome to pull request!=

Oh,Recent days I started to think about to add some new heros in it trough it already has over five heros.

but last night I begin to think about the player's feelings in my game

this game don't have sound,graphics or proper introductions

Few players would enjoy a game only with a bunch of dully codes

so I decide to change the lanuages of it and design a unique UI to make it colorful
