the new realese for the ultra legendsv1.2.5!

inspried by genshi impact and hotta ,i decided to add some lucky part in the game 

players can use the core to make wish!

the god(the system ,of course) could possibly give you some kind repeats,or just leave you alone...

Have a happy game,and welcome to pull request!

Oh,Recent days I started to think about to add some new heros in it trough it already has over five heros.

but last night I begin to think about the player's feelings in my game

this game don't have sound,graphics or proper introductions

Few players would enjoy a game only with a bunch of dully codes

so I decide to change the lanuages of it and design a unique UI to make it colorful

Sorry,recent days I have to get along with my tests,though I feel good at C,but I still don't feel good at math 

I...put the game developing aside,but I have planned,about the game's future

At first I decide to add a packing system in the game to let hero could only have the weapon no more than 10

then I decide to add a new hero to make the game more colorful

that hero I want to make it to have two skills,instead, he cannot use the ordinary attack,it's wise to save the MP

I also think that I can turn the game into a more colorful and happy game ,more NPCs,more active interactions

Maybe I need to study harder!
